# Testing

## How it works?
Tests are created in the `input` folder and hand processed to create the expected output in the `expected_output` folder. Then during testing the 'compiler' is used to attempt to convert the each input to its expected output and these files are compared.

> Note: Every input file must share the same name as their accompanying expected output file.
